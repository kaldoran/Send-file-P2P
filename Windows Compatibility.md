# How to compile the program on Windows

## Requiered 
- First you will need to install [openSSL] (http://slproweb.com/download/Win32OpenSSL-1_0_1L.exe)
- You also need [Code::Blocks From SourceForge] ( http://sourceforge.net/projects/codeblocks/files/Binaries/13.12/Windows/codeblocks-13.12mingw-setup.exe )
- [Our projet] (https://github.com/UJM-INFO/p2p-a/archive/master.zip)

Please install openSSL in the default directory. 

** Note :** if your hard drive don't have C: as name, please referred to the end of this tutorial.

# Prepare for Code::Blocks
After that, unzip our project, then copy all the SRC/* and INC/* into the directory that contains the *cbp

# Start with Code::Blocks
You can now open the *.cbp file.
You need then to click on the gears in the code::blocks toolbar.

Wait a bit, then if it's good you are going to see a "bin" directory in your unzipped project.
Open it and go in "Release" you should see a ".exe" file.

Congrate you can now start your program by double click on it :D
Have fun.


## My hard drive don't have the C: name.
You are in the good part, if this is the case, then you need to reconfigure the *.cpb file.
Let's see how.
