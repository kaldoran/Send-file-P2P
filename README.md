#### How to change into debug mode ?

/!\ All part are in normal use mode by default.

To start the debug mode, you just need to change ( each ) makefile, switch the 
"DEBUG=no" line 2 by "DEBUG=yes", then recompile it and then you can see Debug message.

( Debug mode doesn't change how to use each part ).

If you want the debug mode on windows, please refere to "Windows Compatibility" file.
